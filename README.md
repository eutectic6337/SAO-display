A modular system for displaying
[Shitty Add-Ons](https://hackaday.com/2019/03/20/introducing-the-shitty-add-on-v1-69bis-standard/)
on a wall, with their lights a-blinin'.

Points:
- hexagonal mocules, for arbitrary tiling
- magnetic pogo-pin connectors for power distribution
- a buck converter on each module to minimise power loss through pogo pins
- space for art
- 3D-printed surrounds
